You're looking to build a comprehensive messaging app called \"Connect,\" similar to WhatsApp, with a focus on real-time communication, security, and a user-friendly interface. Here's a plan to get started with the initial version of the app using React Native and Expo:\n\n**Features for the First Version (MVP):**\n\n*   **User Registration & Authentication:** Phone number-based registration with SMS verification.\n*   **Real-Time Messaging:** One-to-one chat with typing indicators and message read receipts.\n*   **UI/UX Design:** A clean and intuitive interface with a light theme.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F7F9FC` (Very light grey for a clean feel)\n    *   Text: `#2D3436` (Dark grey for readability)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#747474` (Medium grey for less important text)\n    *   Primary: `#007AFF` (Apple's blue, for main interactive elements)\n    *   Secondary: `#34C759` (Green, for success states and accents)\n    *   Accent: `#FF9500` (Orange, for highlights and calls to action)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White, for cards and content containers)\n    *   Highlight: `#E2E2E2` (Light grey, for subtle highlights)\n*   **Typography:** Use the default system fonts for a native look and feel. They are generally clean and modern.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Implement User Interface:**\n    *   Modify the `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` file to remove the modalDemos array. This will simplify the home screen for the initial MVP.\n    *   Adjust the color scheme in `app/_layout.tsx` to reflect the colors specified above. This will set the overall theme for the app.\n    *   Update the tab bar in `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` to include icons and labels relevant to the core features (e.g., a chat icon for messaging, a user icon for profile).\n\nI will now instruct the coding agent to implement the plan. After the implementation, the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-19T22:21:02.874165"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build the Connect messaging app!
